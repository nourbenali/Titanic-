Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster Using Some Supervised Learning Methods

The purpose of this project is to apply some supervised machine learning methods on the dataset "Titanic".

The methods applied are :
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNN
  - SVM
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Networks

By the end of this project, a comparison between the models was made in order to choose the one with the best accuracy score.
